## Memposter
Interested in memes? well we have got something intresting for you. Presenting to you Memposter, a ML based game were user has to copy the given expression and wil be rated on the basis of accuracy.
 # The video demo of this project can be found in
 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIhjqoKItoI)
## Built on 

The game is built using Tensorflow,Pytorch Keras, CNN, HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

## Starting the project on your local machine 

  -> Install all the packages in requirement.txt file

  -> You will get a model.pt as output from running 
  
  -> Then run app.py in your localhost and enjoy the game

## Contribution Guidelines
If you want to contribute to our project you can fork our repository and commit to the new sub-branch.
### Improvements required
1) We have trained our model from the subset of the data provided in (https://ai.google/tools/datasets/google-facial-expression/), so utilizing more data may help model to get more reliable embeddings.

2) Image augmentation also required, as the app we use takes feed from webcam and is of poor quality which is not exactly from the distribution model was trained on, so some image tranformation to webcam like images may help model to differentiate between expressions.
